Simple Hosting Oriented Account Direcotory (SHOAD)

SHOAD is basically a frontend for an LDAP server which is supposed to hold
user account and membership information in trees isolated by access control.

What does this project aim to provide:
- JSON interface for manipulating user entries
- LDAP attribute names translation into desired JSON api names.
- jQuery extensions for very quick implementation of UI for user account listing and editing.
- More coming soon...

Currently the project is in the "pre-alpha-first-milestone" stage, but I'm planning to come up
with some beta within this summer of 2011.
